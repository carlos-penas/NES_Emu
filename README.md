# NES Emulator

An emulator for the videogame console NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) developed in C++ and the graphics library SFML, originally developed as the final project of my software engineering degree.

The emulator currently supports Mapper 0 and NTSC video system, which means it is compatible with ~100 different videogames of the NES catalogue.

The Audio Processing Unit (APU) is not implemented, so the emulator isn't capable of producing any sound yet.
